LSculpt: Studs-out LEGO® Sculpture

LSculpt is a program which converts a triangle mesh into an LDraw file. Like the sphere generator, the generated model consists of a surface of 1×1 plates oriented in whichever direction provides the best detail.

Here's an example sculpture designed with LSculpt. http://lego.bldesign.org/LSculpt/bunnies_624.jpg

download

LSculpt is currently available for Windows. You can download the latest version here.

Interested developers may also take a look at the source code. LSculpt is written in C++. The graphical interface uses the Qt Creator application framework. The preview window is powered by Travis Cobbs' LDView.

working with 3D models

finished models

The bunny model shown on these pages is from the Stanford 3D Scanning Repository. A great list of models and model repositories is available here. Happy hunting!

converting between 3D formats

LSculpt currently supports most PLY, STL, and OBJ files. If you come across other formats, you will need to convert them. * MeshLab, a free program for processing, editing, and converting 3D meshes * 3D Object Converter, a graphical conversion utility between many 3D formats * IVCON (149 KB) Windows command line utility that converts between many 3D formats (source).

creating your own models

Many programs can create files that will work with LSculpt. * Most 3D computer aided design (CAD) software can export to STL. * DAZ 3D and Poser can export Wavefront OBJ files.
